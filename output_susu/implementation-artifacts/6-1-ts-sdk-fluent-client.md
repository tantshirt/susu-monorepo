# Story 6.1: TS SDK (@susu/sdk) idiomatic helpers + fluent client

Status: done

## Story

As an integrator,
I want `@susu/sdk` to expose idiomatic TypeScript helpers (`createGroup`, `acceptInvite`, `postCollateral`, `contribute`, `claimPayout`, `topUpCollateral`, `withdrawCollateral`, `cancelGroup`, `queryHistory`, `getGroup`, `getMemberPosition`) over a fluent `createSusuClient()` builder,
so that I can integrate Susu into a Solana app in <30 minutes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** the Codama-generated TS surface from Epic 1 Story 1.3, **when** `sdk/ts/src/index.ts` exposes the public API, **then** the fluent client is `createSusuClient().use(signer(...)).use(solanaDevnetRpc({...}))`.
2. Every helper accepts a typed argument bag (e.g., `contribute(client, { group, amount })`) and returns a `Promise<TransactionSignature>` for state-changing instructions or a typed account for reads.
3. Every helper internally calls into the Codama-generated instruction builder; no hand-rolled instruction encoding.
4. The helpers are documented inline with JSDoc; every public export has at least one runnable example in the docstring.
5. Unit tests in `sdk/ts/tests/` cover each helper against a mocked RPC.
6. Every state-changing helper, by default, prepends `ComputeBudgetProgram.setComputeUnitLimit(200_000)` and `setComputeUnitPrice(<priorityFee from Helius getPriorityFeeEstimate>)` instructions to the transaction. Override via `{ computeUnits, priorityFee }` opts. Without this, mainnet-beta transactions under 2026 congestion will exceed wall-clock budgets and break the 60s `pnpm susu:demo` claim (FR37, NFR-P3). Use `@solana/kit`'s compute-budget instruction builders (NOT legacy `@solana/web3.js`).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Author `sdk/ts/src/client.ts` with fluent builder (AC: 1)
  - [x] `createSusuClient(opts)` accepts `{ cluster, rpc, signer? }` and returns a `SusuClient` instance with `.use(plugin)` chaining
  - [x] Internal state holds `{ cluster, rpc, signer, programId }`; throws if `cluster` missing (Story 6.2 enforces stricter rule)
  - [x] Plugin shape: `(client) => Partial<SusuClient>` — composable signer/rpc/cluster plugins
- [x] Implement state-changing helpers (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] `createGroup(client, args)` → wraps `getCreateGroupInstructionAsync` from `generated/`
  - [x] `acceptInvite(client, args)` → wraps generated `getAcceptInviteInstructionAsync`
  - [x] `postCollateral(client, args)` → wraps generated builder
  - [x] `contribute(client, args)` → wraps generated builder
  - [x] `claimPayout(client, args)` → wraps generated builder
  - [x] `topUpCollateral(client, args)` → wraps generated builder
  - [x] `withdrawCollateral(client, args)` → wraps generated builder
  - [x] `cancelGroup(client, args)` → wraps generated builder
  - [x] Each returns `Promise<TransactionSignature>` (after Story 6.2 wraps with simulate-by-default)
- [x] Implement read helpers (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] `getGroup(client, groupPda)` → fetches + decodes Group account via `fetchGroup` from `generated/accounts/`
  - [x] `getMemberPosition(client, args)` → derives Member PDA, fetches + decodes
  - [x] `queryHistory(client, args)` → reads RotationHistory entries (paginated)
- [x] Surface public API in `sdk/ts/src/index.ts` (AC: 1)
  - [x] Re-export `createSusuClient`, all helpers, types from `generated/types/`, error classes (Story 6.3)
  - [x] `package.json` `"main"` / `"module"` / `"types"` point at `dist/`; `"exports"` map declares `.` and `./generated`
- [x] Document every public export with JSDoc + runnable example (AC: 4)
  - [x] Each helper has `@example` block with kit-first imports
  - [x] `README.md` for `@susu/sdk` package mirrors top-level docs/sdk-typescript.md
- [x] Unit tests at `sdk/ts/tests/` (AC: 5)
  - [x] Mock RPC via `@solana/kit` test harness or fakes
  - [x] One happy-path test per helper; assert generated builder is invoked with expected args
  - [x] Coverage target: every public export touched by ≥1 test

## Dev Notes

### Architecture compliance (non-negotiables)

- **Kit-first imports only.** All client/RPC code uses `@solana/kit` and `@solana/web3-compat` for legacy boundaries. Importing `@solana/web3.js` is a forbidden pattern enforced by CI lint (Story 1.4). The architecture decision is locked.
- **No hand-rolled instruction encoding.** Every state-changing helper delegates to a Codama-generated builder under `sdk/ts/src/generated/instructions/`. If a helper appears to need custom encoding, the IDL or codegen pipeline is wrong — fix it, do not bypass it.
- **Generated files are read-only.** `sdk/ts/src/generated/` carries the `// DO NOT EDIT — regenerate via pnpm sdk:codegen` banner from Story 1.3. Hand-edits are blocked by CI grep check.
- **Fluent client uses kit's plugin idiom.** `createSusuClient().use(signer(...))` mirrors how `@solana/kit` composes RPC + signer. Do not invent a parallel composition system.
- **Simulate-by-default and explicit-cluster gate land in Story 6.2** — this story authors helpers with the integration points (a `simulate?: boolean` arg threading through, cluster validation hook) but the enforcement logic ships in 6.2.

### Project Structure Notes

- This story depends on Story 1.3 (Codama TS codegen) producing `sdk/ts/src/generated/` and Story 1.2 (IDL freeze) producing the locked IDL hash. No re-freeze required for 6.1 — public surface is fixed.
- Peer dependencies declared in `sdk/ts/package.json`: `@solana/kit`, `@solana/web3-compat`. Direct dependency: `@solana-program/compute-budget` for the SDK's internal compute-budget instruction prepending.
- The `package.json` name is `@susu/sdk`; `version` initially `0.1.0-alpha.0` (publish pipeline lands in Story 6.12).

### Forbidden patterns

- `import … from '@solana/web3.js'` anywhere in `sdk/ts/src/` — use `@solana/kit` + `@solana/web3-compat` only.
- Hand-rolling instruction byte layout, discriminators, account-meta arrays — always go through `generated/instructions/`.
- Editing files under `sdk/ts/src/generated/` — read-only; regenerate via `pnpm sdk:codegen`.
- `process.env.X` reads inside the SDK — SDK is config-via-args only.
- Bare `throw new Error('…')` — Story 6.3 mandates typed error classes; author helpers ready to throw the typed classes.

### Testing standards

- Vitest under `sdk/ts/tests/`. One file per helper. Mock RPC via injected fake; assert the helper calls the right Codama builder with the right args. Coverage gate ≥80% on `sdk/ts/src/helpers/`.
- Parity tests vs. Rust SDK (Story 6.5) live in `sdk/ts/tests/parity.test.ts` — author the file stub now with TODO; full assertions land in 6.5.
- CI runs `pnpm --filter @susu/sdk test` on every PR (wired in Story 1.4).

### Debug Log References

- `node --test tests/atdd/story-6-1-ts-sdk-fluent-client.static.red.test.mjs` failed before implementation with missing client/helper/README/export surface, then passed after implementation.
- `pnpm --filter @susu/sdk build` passed after implementation.
- `pnpm --filter @susu/sdk test` passed after implementation: 20 passed, 1 todo.
- `pnpm test:atdd` passed after implementation: 151 passed.
- `bash scripts/check-patterns.sh` passed.
- `bash scripts/check-sdk-parity.sh` passed and did not modify generated files.
- `pnpm --filter @susu/sdk test` passed after test-review cleanup: 20 passed, 1 todo.
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` passed after dependency/export changes.
- Code review completed with no remaining findings.
- Cursor Bugbot findings on PR #177 were fixed during recovery: `queryHistory(..., { before })` now returns entries before the cursor, and the unused exported `prependComputeBudgetInstructions` helper was removed.
- Recovery validation after Cursor fixes passed `git diff --check`, `pnpm --filter @susu/sdk build`, `pnpm --filter @susu/sdk test` (20 passed, 1 todo), `pnpm test:atdd` (151 passed), `bash scripts/check-patterns.sh`, and `bash scripts/check-sdk-parity.sh`.
- Cursor Bugbot follow-up finding on PR #177 was fixed during second recovery: `queryHistory(..., { limit: 0 })` now returns an empty page.
- Second recovery validation after the zero-limit fix passed `git diff --check`, `pnpm --filter @susu/sdk build`, `pnpm --filter @susu/sdk test` (20 passed, 1 todo), `pnpm test:atdd` (151 passed), `bash scripts/check-patterns.sh`, and `bash scripts/check-sdk-parity.sh`.
- Cursor Bugbot follow-up finding on PR #177 was fixed during third recovery: `sendInstructions` now only accepts explicit own RPC send hooks, so standard kit RPC proxy methods do not bypass `SusuTransactionSendError`.
- Third recovery validation after the proxy send-hook fix passed `git diff --check`, `pnpm --filter @susu/sdk build`, `pnpm --filter @susu/sdk test` (21 passed, 1 todo), `pnpm test:atdd` (151 passed), `bash scripts/check-patterns.sh`, and `bash scripts/check-sdk-parity.sh`.
- Cursor Bugbot follow-up finding on PR #177 was fixed during fourth recovery: `@solana-program/compute-budget` is now a direct SDK dependency instead of a consumer-facing peer dependency.
- Cursor Bugbot follow-up finding on PR #177 was fixed during fifth recovery: fluent plugins can now explicitly clear `computeUnits` and `priorityFee` overrides back to SDK defaults/estimation by returning those keys with `undefined`.
- Pre-done PR gate check on PR #177 passed for head `f46a6a4101abe0c56c5c3677c05ed0c2003613e3`: `lint-and-build` succeeded at `https://github.com/tantshirt/susu-monorepo/actions/runs/25563793572/job/75041897951`, Cursor Bugbot completed `SUCCESS`, and GraphQL review-thread audit found 6 Cursor threads, all resolved, with no unresolved current-head Cursor threads.

### Completion Notes List

- Added fluent `SusuClient` with `createSusuClient().use(...)`, signer/RPC/cluster plugins, typed config errors, and default Susu program ID.
- Added state-changing helper wrappers that call the current Codama-generated builder functions under `sdk/ts/src/generated/instructions/`; no generated files were edited.
- Added compute-budget prepending through kit-compatible `@solana-program/compute-budget` builders, Helius-style `getPriorityFeeEstimate` support, and `{ computeUnits, priorityFee }` overrides.
- Added client-based read wrappers over existing generated decoder/PDA query helpers.
- Added package-local README, dist export map, and mocked Vitest coverage for client, state helpers, and read helpers.
- Test review completed with no remaining findings; strengthened state-helper tests to assert per-helper generated-builder argument bags.
- Code review completed clean; no patch, decision, or deferred findings remain.
- Recovery passes fixed all Cursor Bugbot findings observed before rerunning PR gates.
- Fourth recovery pass moved the internal compute-budget package to runtime dependencies, keeping only `@solana/kit` and `@solana/web3-compat` as peer dependencies.
- Fifth recovery pass changed plugin merging to distinguish absent patch keys from explicit `undefined`, preserving immutability while allowing compute-budget override resets.
- Marked Story 6.1 done after clean PR CI and Cursor evidence on the implementation head; the status-only commit will be re-gated before merge.
